# Type

***

### The types of PIE lang

* `byte` - Saving Bytes  
* `int` - Saving interger (`−2,147,483,648` ~ `2,147,483,647`)  
* `num` - Saving actual number. (`−2,147,483,648.0` ~ `2,147,483,647.0`)    
* `string` - Saving unicode characters. The limit of the length of string is `4,294,967,295`.  
* `list` - Saving arrangement. All types including constant can be in list.  
* `map` - Saving mapping.  
* `boolean` - Saving true/talse, you can write True or true(they're same) and False or false(they're same)
* `cons` - Saving constant. You can't edit this, and you can put every type in it.
* `tuple` - Saving constant, but it is similar to list.

***

### Defining constant or variable

***

```
#define var name.type (value)
```


- If you don't write value, the variable will have initial value.
- You must write value when you define constant
- Also, you can use `DEFINE` instead of `define`, but I don't recommned it.

#### The Initial Value

* int, num = 0
* boolean = false
* byte, string, list, map = none

### The rule of name of variable

***

It's so important that naming the value, but you should follow rules.

1. You can write only number(1234567890), alphabet(abcdefg....), `-`, and `_` in name.
2. The name can't start with number. Others(alphabet, dash, and underbar) are OK.
3. You can make two variables named same, but the type of it should be diffrent.
4. You should write blank between type and value.

### Example

***
```

#define int_var.int (3) | O
#define 33int_r.int (3) | X (no starting with number)
#define _ins_dd.int (3) | O
#define _desx.int (-2.3) | X (not interger)

#define ddd.boolean (false) | O
#define ddd.boolean (False) | O
#define ddd.boolean (True) | O
#define ddd.boolean (true) | O

#define ddd.num (−2147483623) | X (too small)
#define ddd.num (2147483623) | X (too big)

#define d.cons () | O
#define d.cons (12342) | O

#define d@1.int (234) | X (no special character)

#define ddd.tuple (4533, 23, 'ddd') | O
